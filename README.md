# Force Aware Branch Manipulation To Assist Agricultural Tasks
This study presents a methodology to safely manipulate branches to aid various agricultural tasks. Humans in a real agricultural environment often manipulate branches to perform agricultural tasks effectively, but current agricultural robots lack this capability. This proposed strategy to manipulate branches can aid in different precision agriculture tasks, such as fruit picking in dense foliage, pollinating flowers under occlusion, and moving overhanging vines and branches for navigation. The proposed method modifies RRT* to plan a path that satisfies the branch geometric constraints and obeys branch deformable characteristics. Re-planning is done to obtain a path that helps the robot exert force within a desired range so that branches are not damaged during manipulation. Experimentally, this method achieved a success rate of 78% across 50 trials, successfully moving a branch from different starting points to a target region.
